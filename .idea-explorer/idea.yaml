idea:
  title: Carrot or Stick?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: "The way prompts are phrased\u2014whether polite and appreciative (e.g.,\
    \ including \"thank you\") or strict and commanding\u2014affects LLM performance,\
    \ but existing empirical evidence is mixed; a meta-study is needed to determine\
    \ which approach is more effective.\n"
  background:
    description: There are ideas floating around about whether it improves LLM performance
      to be nice and say "thank you" to them or to be strict and commanding. There
      is empirical evidence for both views but I don't think we have a definitive
      answer yet. Why is that? Can we do a meta-study to see which side is more convincing?
